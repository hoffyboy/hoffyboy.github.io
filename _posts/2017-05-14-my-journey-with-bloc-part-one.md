title: "My Journey with Bloc: Part One"
---

Since I started learning how to code at Bloc, my days have been very exciting. I'm thrilled to get up and go through my day just so I can sit down at the end of the day and code away with Bloc's curriculum for a few hours. Bloc's curriculum is exceptional and keeps things interesting. It gives me a feeling of accomplishment seeing how much I've learned so far and what I can build.

The first few weeks at Bloc I learned the fundamentals of front-end web development. It was fairly easy learning HTML and CSS my first week, primarily because I had already learned some of the basics of HTML and CSS some years prior. The next week I learned command line and Git, which were very confusing to me at first, but I eventually got the gist of it, for the most part. The next week I got on to learn some introductory JavaScript which wasn't so difficult considering that I coded before in Visual Basic and a lot of the core concepts of programming were the same: if/else statements, loops, etc,. The following two weeks when I got on to learn intermediate and advanced JavaScript, that's when things got tough. Learning about function expressions and closures really got my neurons firing, and it certainly got my brain hurting trying to grasp the concept of nested functions and function calls within other functions. But luckily I was able to reach out to my mentor, more the less, when I couldn't understand difficult concepts. Once I had finished learning all the fundamentals, I needed to take a progress assessment test in order to progress to the front-end foundations. The test was done via video calling by a dedicated progress assessor. I was given about 15-20 questions and was tested on most of the concepts that I had learned so far. I did very well for my first test and scored a 9.5 points out of 10.

Once I got onto the foundations, I had to build a music player accessed through your web browser. It wasn't so difficult because each checkpoint outlined the code needed to build the music player, and I was guided through most of the building process. Going through each checkpoint, it was interesting to see my music player slowly come to life little by little. Every few checkpoints I was taught a new concept such as DOM scripting, jQuery, and some other JavaScript libraries. When I had finally finished the foundation checkpoints, I got to see my fully working music player.

Next, I was onto learning AngularJS. I had to build the same music player but written with the AngularJS framework instead. I was mostly guided through the earlier checkpoints, but the latter checkpoints they expected me to figure out some of the concepts for myself without any guidance. They say that figuring things out for yourself when learning to develop is when you really learn the most. Even though I knew this, it still got really frustrating at times trying to figure how to get things working for myself, especially since I was used to being guided through each checkpoint.

When I was done learning AngularJS, it was on to the projects. For my first project I had to build a chat room app on my own using AngularJS. None of the code was displayed for me; I had to figure it all out for myself. During this project, I can definitely say that I learned the most. It may have been really frustrating during each step of the process, but it was so satisfying knowing that I figured it all out on my own. Once I finished the project, I added extra functionality to the chat room, which Bloc didn't require, because I enjoyed it so much. After that project I knew that I had truly found my passion.
