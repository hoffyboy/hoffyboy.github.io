title: My Entry into Development
---

I first started teaching myself Visual Basic about ten years ago. For my first app, I made a program for eBay sellers to calculate their fees and profit on items they sold.

I loved development from the very beginning. It was lots of fun trying to build an app from scratch and getting it to function correctly. But since I was young and self-taught, I didn't think about the prospect of turning my love for coding into a career. I mostly saw it as just a fun hobby to challenge myself. But my newfound hobby didn't last much longer. After about a year or so I lost the enthusiasm for coding mainly because I didn't know where to get the tools or the education to become a more experienced developer.

Over the next several years, I attended several semesters at college without really deciding on a major. I picked Business Administration as my major without fully deciding that that was what I wanted to pursue. I wasn't fully committed because I simply wasn't sure that that is the future I wanted to pursue. In order for me to be fully committed, I needed to find my true passion. While pursuing my business degree, I would drive Uber during my free time to help pay the bills. Driving Uber also offered me the flexible hours that I needed for school.

Some months back, while I was driving Uber, one of my passengers told me that she was a developer and that she loved her job developing. She informed me that the development industry is starving for more developers and that there aren't enough developers for the positions that need to be filled. This got me thinking about getting back into development, especially when she told me about these new short-term coding bootcamps that have been popping up lately around the country which guarantee you a job in the industry upon completion.

I immediately started doing research to find the best coding bootcamp to fit my needs. After a several days of meticulous comparisons between a few coding bootcamps that I was interested in, I narrowed down my options to Bloc. I found that Bloc would be the best choice for me simply because it is completely self-paced and all online. There aren't lots of people that can do an online school or online bootcamp; they'd need somebody on top of them setting deadlines and disciplining them to learn. Thankfully, I do very well learning on my own and at my own pace rather than the traditional classroom setting. I pride myself in my self-disciplinary skills and my love for learning that which I'm truly passionate about.

From the development tracks they offered, I chose the full stack web development track. The Bloc program also includes frequent online mentor meetings, projects, assignments, checkpoints, tests and so much more. I'm now 3 months or 1/3rd into the Bloc program, and I'm loving it. Their curriculum is just outstanding and very well thought out. Their projects really challenge you and gets you thinking how to solve problems like an experienced developer. It's really lots of fun; I love to be challenged. As of now, I had just completed the front-end module and all of its the projects, and I'm about to start learning the back-end. So far I've learned:

* Git & GitHub
* Command Line
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* AngularJS
* and various other libraries

I'm really excited to start learning the back-end and some Ruby on Rails. When I finish with Bloc I'm going to teach myself more JavaScript frameworks and learn some more back-end languages like PHP or Python. It's exciting to always be learning new things.
