## Explanation

The TimePlace was built entirely with Rails. The main gems that I used for this project are ActsAsBookable, IceCube, and Bootstrap. The main component is the scheduling aspect - where clients can book an appointment from a list of times that the buyer is available to meet.

When starting this project, I immediately began research to find a scheduling gem that I could build my application around and therefore not have to build the whole scheduling component from scratch. After extensive hours of research I came across ActsAsBookable. The ActsAsBookable gem allows resources to be booked by users and works in conjunction with IceCube which allows easy creation of recurrence rules and fast querying. I ran into some issues trying to figure out how the ActsAsBookable and IceCube gems work. Since these gems were new to me, I had to dig through all of their documentation in order to get them to work properly.
